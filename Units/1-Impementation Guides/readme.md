# Implementation Guides

>This Unit discusses the most globally relevant implementation guides (IG) currently in use: Argonaut/US CORE and International Patient Summary.


## This Week's Assignment

>Since this is the first week, we will not have extensive programming assignments, but we will 
>provide you with some small [*Argonaut*](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/2015Jan/argonauts.html) and [*IPS*](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/) example programs in C#, Python and JavaScript so 
>you can get used to access FHIR data using FHIR client or plain http access libraries. 
>
>It’s a good time to set up your environment. Get a good code editor, like [*Sublime*](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) or [*Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (highly recommended for all the platforms - even Java! -, VS Code works in Windows /
>MacOS / Linux.
>
>Make sure you can run JavaScript, Java or C#, whatever you prefer.
>For this unit, there is a quiz and a first set of assignments. 
>You will have to review or write small fragments of code, select IGs/resources and answer some 
>questions on what you’ve learned about Argonaut and IPS in this unit.
