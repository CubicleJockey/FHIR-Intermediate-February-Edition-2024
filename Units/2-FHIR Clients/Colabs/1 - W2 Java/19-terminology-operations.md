## Terminology Operations
We will go through the most used terminology operations. There are a few more, but we are not covering those in the FHIR intermediate course.

We'll cover:

| Operation                    | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| **CodeSystem/$lookup**       | Recover all information from a specific-code from a codesystem |
| **ValueSet/$expand**         | Get all the concepts from a specific valueset, (optionally, matching some filter) |
| **ValueSet/$validate_code**  | Validate a code against a ValueSet                                |
