# This subunit's goal: HAPI FHIR for Java

This particular sub-unit talks about the HAPI FHIR Java library, so we call this "Our HAPI FHIR Java Handbook."

**Note:**

It's not "THE HAPI FHIR Java Handbook" because we included only the information relevant for you to be able to fulfill this unit's goals.

HAPI FHIR is very powerful, and creating a full handbook would take thousands of pages, and that is outside of this course's scope (or maybe any course's scope).

Java HAPI FHIR is maybe the most used client (and server) globally.

It's open-source with optional paid support.

Full, extensive documentation for HAPI FHIR (Client) is available at https://smilecdr.com/hapi-fhir/.

To work with FHIR R4, you will need JDK-8 and HAPI FHIR 3.8.0 or higher (we used this version to validate the examples).
