# Examples, Receipes, and Micro Assignments

Throughout these sections, you will see three different icons:

![Example Icon](./images/example-icon.png)
- The "example" icon means that what follows is a code example with actual values for the parameters it uses.
  
  Some examples are not in-line with the text due to their length. You will need to refer to an external file.

  Some of the long examples are also in GitHub Gist. When such an example is included, you will also see the GitHub icon.

![Recipe Icon](./images/recipe-icon.png)
- The "recipe" icon signals a "Recipe" or template. Recipes are code snippets with pseudo variables, objects, or data type names.

  After the code or pseudocode of the recipe, there will be a table of the pseudo variables you will need to replace.

  Pseudo variables are signaled like this: |PseudoVariableName|

  You need to replace these pseudo variables with your actual variable, class, or attribute names.

  Example |ResourceName| --> Patient

  Sometimes to illustrate a method we use both examples and recipes, and sometimes only examples, depending on the subject's complexity.

![Micro-Assignment Icon](./images/micro-assignment-icon.png)
- This "Micro Assignment" icon signals a "Micro Assignment," which is intended to allow you to try the recipes and examples presented throughout the section. Remember that Micro Assignments:

  a) Are NOT graded, and we will provide the solutions along with this reading material

  

  b) Are NOT "the assignments for this unit." These Micro Assignments are just for you to learn small concepts, one at a time.
