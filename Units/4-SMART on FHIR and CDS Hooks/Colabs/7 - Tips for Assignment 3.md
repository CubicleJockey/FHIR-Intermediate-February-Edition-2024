# Tips For Assignment #3

For this assignment you need to fix the script that creates the card.

**Tip #3.1:** 

Where to look?

This script is not part of the provided project. It's a mock that simulate the cms-price-check service published at https://fhir-org-cds-services.appspot.com/cds-services that we use in our app. Find the script code at the activity page.

**Tip #3.2:** 

It 's not a sintaxis language issue. This code was audited by a senior developer and there are no mistakes, so take a look at the CDS Hooks standard part.

**Send your submission**

You need to send the complete script code. From `if (price) {" to "}`
